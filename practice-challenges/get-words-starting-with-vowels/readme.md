# Get Words Starting with Vowels

Write a function that takes in a list of words. Return a list of words that
start with a vowel.

Vowels are `aeiou`. You don't have to worry about capital letters (although,
it makes for a great bonus challenge).

For example:

```
["elephant", "hello", "octopus"] => ['elephant', 'octopus']

["hi", "meow", "yay"] => []
```

## Solutions

- [Python](get_vowel_words.py)
- [JavaScript](getVowelWords.js)
