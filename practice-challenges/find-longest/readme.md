# Find Longest Word

Write a function that takes in a list of words. It should return the longest
word (the one with the greats amount of characters) in the list.

If there's a tie, return the word that appears earliest.

For example:

```
["boo", "a", "I", "hi"] => 'boo'

["one", "two", "superduper", "dog"] => 'superduper'

["hello", "world"] => 'hello'
```

## Solutions
