# Find Longest Word

Write a function that takes in a list of words. It should return the longest
word (the one with the greats amount of characters) in the list.

If there's a tie, return the word that appears earliest.

For example:

```
['boo', 'a', 'I', 'hi'] => 'boo'

['one', 'two', 'superduper', 'dog'] => 'superduper'

['hello', 'world'] => 'hello'
```
