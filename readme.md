## ‚ùì How do these interviews work?

Our interviews are about **30 min. long**, so you should set aside 30 min. of
time where you're free, have access to the internet, and able to talk with
someone on the phone.

During the interview, you'll get a phone call from one of our friendly
interviewers. You'll work with the interviewer to solve a code challenge **in
your programming language of choice** (you don't have to know Python yet!).

Your interviewer will save some time at the end of the 30 min. where you can
ask questions about the program ü§ó

## üòé Am I ready to book a technical interview?

If you can do the following, you're probably ready to book an interview:

- [ ] Have worked with strings, numbers (integers), and arrays/lists before
- [ ] Can think of an example of when you'd use a while-loop and when you'd use
  a for-loop
- [ ] Write a function with parameters that returns a value
- [ ] Add up all the numbers in an array/list of numbers by hand (without using
  built-in functions or methods)
- [ ] Use conditional logic and loops to filter an array/list (ex.: "given a
  list of words, return all words that start with `'b'`")

## üîÆ Where can I find practice questions?

There are lots of online resources with practice questions but it's difficult
for us to vet the quality of those resources. So, while we can't recommend a
particular resource, we *can* provide practice questions of our own.

Be aware that these questions **are not representative** of the types of
code challenges you'll *actually* encounter during the interview. Also, a code
challenge can vary in difficulty from person to person ‚Äî a question that you
think is easy might be hard for someone else (and vice versa). So, we **can't
guarantee that you'll pass the interview if you complete these questions.**
The good news is that we also can't guarantee that you *won't* pass the
interview if you aren't able to solve these questions üòÅ.

## üí° Tips for a Successful Interview

- We conduct our interviews on a site similar to [replit.com](https://replit.com/).
  Since replit.com is free, we recommend taking some time to familiarize yourself
  with the platform.
- You won't be allowed to refer to notes or use outside resources (like Google)
  to help you with syntax during the interview. If you're struggling with syntax
  or don't know what to do next, don't worry! Just let the interviewer know and
  they'll point you in the right direction.
- Run your code often throughout the interview. Being a good programming means
  being a good debugger, so don't be afraid to read error messages carefully.
- Your interviewer will understand how nerve-wracking it can be to program
  in front of someone. It happens to everyone, no matter how experienced they
  are. If you draw a blank or get stuck, that's okay! Use this as an
  opportunity to communicate effectively about what you do understand and
  what you don't understand.
- Your interviewer wants to help you pass the interview. It may be helpful to
  think of them as a collaborator rather than a test proctor.
- Technical interviews help you and us determine whether you are ready to take
  on the challenges of our Software Engineering course. In order to get the most
  out of our program, we need to make sure you are comfortable with certain
  programming basics including: basic data types (strings, integers, booleans,
  lists), conditional logic, indexing, looping, and functions.
- If you don't pass the interview on your first try, don't panic! We'll provide
  feedback on where you can improve and discuss a timeline for when you can
  reinterview.
