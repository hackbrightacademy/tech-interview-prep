# Get Words Starting with Vowels

Write a function that takes in a list of words. Return a list of words that
start with a vowel.

Vowels are `aeiou`. You don't have to worry about capital letters (although,
it makes for a great bonus challenge).

For example:

```
['elephant', 'hello', 'octopus'] => ['elephant', 'octopus']

['hi', 'meow', 'yay'] => []
```
